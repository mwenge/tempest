## Building the Tempest Source Code
In [the `atari_build` folder](./atari_build/) you'll find the steps for building the Tempest source
code at home. There are complications, but it can be done!

## Extracting and Playing the ROMs 
In [this Jupyter notebook](./notebooks/Reconstruct%20ROMs%20from%20Object%20FIles%20in%20the%20Tempest%20Source%20Dump.ipynb) we
extract the ROM data from the `ALEXEC.LDA` binary included in the source dump and play it on MAME!
