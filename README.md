## Building the Tempest Source Code: An Introduction
In [the `atari_build` folder](./atari_build/) you'll find the steps for building the Tempest source
code at home. There are complications, but it can be done!

## Extracting and Playing the ROMs 
In [this Jupyter notebook](./notebooks/Reconstruct%20ROMs%20from%20Object%20FIles%20in%20the%20Tempest%20Source%20Dump.ipynb) we
extract the ROM data from the `ALEXEC.LDA` binary included in the source dump and play it on MAME!

## Building the Tempest Source Code: Version 1
In [this Jupyter notebook](./notebooks/Build%20Tempest%20Sources%20for%20Version%201.ipynb) we build and play Version 1 of Tempest.

## Building the Tempest Source Code: Version 2A(Alt) 
In [this Jupyter notebook](./notebooks/Build%20Tempest%20Sources%20for%20Version%202A(Alt).ipynb) we build and play Version 2A(alt) of Tempest.

## Building the Tempest Source Code: "Look Mom, No Hands."
In [this separate repositoy](https://github.com/mwenge/tempest_fun) we completely automate the build process.
